    <h1>Sarah Wiemeyer's Biography</h1>
    <h2>Coder and Sudoku Enthustiast Studying at Syracuse University</h2>
    <p>My name is Sarah Wiemeyer, and I am an applied data science student with an interest in predictive analyses and web design. I am experienced in both SQL and Python Programming languages, and maintain a high level of statistical knowledge. I am involved in the NEXIS data science team, where I <strong> lead </strong>a strong group of 6 girls in a project that analyzed the influence of student run magazines on and off campus. Outside of school, I enjoy playing the piano, reading, working out, and having fun with fashion. The last interest has <strong>assured</strong> that my bedroom floor is almost always covered with clothes. One character trait that I really like about myself is the way that I am able to embrace change. When I was young, we moved around a lot, and I think that that has allowed me to let go of places and embrace new ones rather easily. For that reason I love to travel, and when I was a junior I studied in Spain the whole school year. When I graduate college, I hope to live abroad again (hopefully in a country that I know the language of this time ÔÅä). When I need to relax, I always gravitate towards dystopian shows and movies. I am a huge Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and Squid Games fan. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
