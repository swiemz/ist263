 <body>
    My name is Sarah Wiemeyer, and I am an applied data science student with an interest in predictive analyses and web design. I am experienced in both SQL and Python Programming languages, and maintain a high level of statistical knowledge. I am involved in the NEXIS data science team, where I lead a group of 6 girls in a project that analyzed the influence of student run magazines on and off campus. Outside of school, I enjoy playing the piano, reading, working out, and having fun with fashion. The last interest has assured that my bedroom floor is almost always covered with clothes. One character trait that I really like about myself is the way that I am able to embrace change. When I was young, we moved around a lot, and I think that that has allowed me to let go of places and embrace new ones rather easily. For that reason I love to travel, and when I was a junior I studied in Spain the whole school year. When I graduate college, I hope to live abroad again (hopefully in a country that I know the language of this time ÔÅä). When I need to relax, I always gravitate towards dystopian shows and movies. I am a huge Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and Squid Games fan. Thanks for visiting my website!
